# What is This?

This is a book by Ken Ribet and William Stein entitled
"Lectures on Modular Forms and Hecke Operators".

# Background

This book began when the second author typed notes for the
first author's 1996 Berkeley course on modular forms with a view
toward explaining some of the key ideas in Wiles's celebrated proof of
Fermat's Last Theorem. The second author then expanded and rewrote the
notes while teaching a course at Harvard in 2003 on modular abelian
varieties.

# Audience

The intended audience of this book is advanced graduate students and
mathematical researchers. This book is more advanced than those of
Lozano, Stein's Intro to Modular Forms, and Diamond-Shurman, and at a
relatively similar level to Diamond-Im, though with more details. It
should be substantially more accessible than a typical research paper
in the area.
